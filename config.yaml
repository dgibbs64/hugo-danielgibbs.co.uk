              Over the course of three years, I held multiple IT-based roles within BAE Systems. My career with the company began with me installing network equipment onboard HMS Prince of Wales before becoming a Combat Systems engineer. In this role, I conducted trials and wrote "Body of Evidence" reports to ensure the product was safe and functional for installation. I also worked on another project, supporting the integration and trials. This included installing cabling infrastructure and clients, maintaining and administering the representative test environment, creating a solution to gather performance metrics, and supporting trial engineers to allow hosted trials to be conducted.
